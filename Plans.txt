- Further tweaks to Galaxy Generation / test re-introduction of v small core for easy compatability with Gigas and other mods adding core. 
- Namelist for Wild Space systems (requires custom star "class")
- Sensor stations for Wild Space? Potentially irrelevant with mid/late game fortresses and sensor rework
- Deepen sensor rework (+ make optional in mod menu)
- Extra-galactic cluster content
- Unstable / moving hyperlanes (have to be optional, too much lag on big maps)
- Advanced start (optional in mod menu)
- Hyperlane anomalies / associated content / mini crisis
- Mechanic to "control" Wild Space from adjacent starbase (locked behind a 'breakthrough' technology).
- Updates to mod menu
